========================

    There is no greater frustration than having a burning desire to play basketball, but having neither team mates nor a
    good court. As many of our classmates are avid ballers with limited social skills, there is a clear need for a better 
    means of finding a pick-up game. Our goal is to remove the barriers in joining basketball players together. WeBall is a 
    location-based app that provides convenient features for basketball enthusiasts to locate nearby pickup games, as well 
    as schedule games in advance. In a world in which so many of our products "i", WeBall seeks to bring people together 
    in a constructive, team-based activity: playing basketball.
